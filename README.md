This project demonstrates a full-stack, asynchronous video processing pipeline. Users can upload videos via a FastAPI REST API, which enqueues processing jobs to a Redis-backed queue. A C++ worker handles heavy-lifting tasks like transcoding videos to multiple formats (MP4, WebM), generating thumbnails, and extracting metadata. The system is fully containerized using Docker Compose and designed for deployment on low-resource VPS instances. It showcases modern backend architecture, async processing, queue-based task management, and integration of high-performance C++ code in a production-ready pipeline.
